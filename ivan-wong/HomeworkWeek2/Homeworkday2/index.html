    <p> This here is Edsger W. Dijkstra I don't really know what else to say or really do so here is just some random text about this guy but not really about this guy which you may not have noticed if I had not discussed about but about now here now without the mention of it or not you will have of noticed that now I have since not talked about this man down here which I will get to see or shortly or relatively to your time very shortly but in actuality never and in a very long time which may accumulate to eternity or I will begin to talk about him now which may contradict what I just said and that is true as you have may noticed but now your just reading this out of boredom, interest or your just weird and in either of those congratualations you're wasting your time reading through this poop if you were skim reading this you may not have noticed the word before or you may have and in which case or in both cases of you reading each and every single word and noticing the odd outlier I congratualate you but still in either way you are wasting your time which could be spent in other activites such as programming since I assume you are either in this course or have some relation to programming so in those cases get back to programming or continue reading of which case I have happy to oblige by filling out more sentences or paragraphs or possibly even pages but right now I am currently going till I run out of ideas to talk about instanteously without pause and also for this to serve as some typing practice for me since I currently am doing this course and faster typing would be appreciated I assume but either way right now my fingers are getting tired of writing so much in a single sitting and fastly so I may stop now or just post lorem but either way I may or may not but you dear reader will find out while I will not since I will continue to type but you can see the entirety of the page and compare it the place here where you are currently reading so yes continue reading dear reader but if I were to create a topic right now it would be about my troubled mindset for this day since I have been reading a book called Blink by Malcolm Gladwell and its contents reveal that those young and short very much like myself have been "held" back or in a matter of cases and in comparisons to be black or woman in an industry since it restricts my opportunies particularly in business and finance which is where I have a keen interest in the enter the market and possibly get my dream job of investment banking there but it seems that my advancement by statistics is significantly low and very disheartening to me but either way it may turn out fine which I do not know. Anyway it is getting late and I have spent a long time just doing this for no reason when as previously discussed could be spent on programming so I shall leave now and finish off whatever I am doing right now which is finishing this website.
